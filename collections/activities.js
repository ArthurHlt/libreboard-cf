// Activities don't need a schema because they are always set from the a trusted
// environment - the server - and there is no risk that a user change the logic
// we use with this collection. Moreover using a schema for this collection
// would be difficult (different activities have different fields) and wouldn't
// bring any direct advantage.
//
// XXX The activities API is not so nice and need some functionalities. For
// instance if a user archive a card, and un-archive it a few seconds later
// we should remove both activities assuming it was an error the user decided
// to revert.
