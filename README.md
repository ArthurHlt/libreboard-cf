# LibreBoard [![Build Status][travis-status]][travis-link]

LibreBoard is an open-source *kanban* board that let you organize things in
cards, and cards in lists. You can use it alone, or with your team and family
thanks to our real-time synchronisation feature. Libreboard is a land of liberty
and you can implement all sort of workflows on it using tags, comments, member
assignation, and many more.

Since it is a free software, you donâ€™t have to trust us with your data and can
install LibreBoard on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to
do that by providing one-click installation for the
[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) platform and verified
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) images.

LibreBoard is released under the very permissive [MIT license](LICENSE), and
made with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).
