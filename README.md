# LibreBoard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/libreboard/libreboard.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/libreboard/libreboard)

LibreBoard is an open-source *kanban* board that let you organize things in
cards, and cards in lists. You can use it alone, or with your team and family
thanks to our real-time synchronisation feature. Libreboard is a land of liberty
and you can implement all sort of workflows on it using tags, comments, member
assignation, and many more.

Since it is a free software, you don't have to trust us with your data. You can
install LibreBoard on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to
do that by providing one-click installation for the
[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) platform and verified
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images.

LibreBoard is released under the very permissive
[MIT license](https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/blob/master/LICENCE), and
made with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).

[Our roadmap is available on LibreBoard](http://libreboard.com/boards/MeSsFJaSqeuo9M6bs/libreboard-roadmap).
